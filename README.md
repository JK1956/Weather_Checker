# Weather Checker
Quickly check live weather updates with the OpenWeather API

## Description
This weather checker has been designed to pull and display weather information for cities across the United States. The application fetches information from OpenWeather's API and displays information such as time, temperature, UV index, 5-day forecast and various graphics to enhance presentation. The application also stores previously searched cities for future use. 

### Issues Resolved
* OpenWeather API fetches real-time data
* localstorage used to store data
* City search history saved and listed
* Information displayed: City name, date, icon representation of weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index
* 5-Day forecast of future weather

### Issues Remaining
* Search button not sitting underneath searchbar
* Search button does not always register but 'enter' button on keyboard always works
